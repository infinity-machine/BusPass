# RIDE4FREE
...5EVER! -*now with rush hour logic!*- -*piss not included*-\

*UPDATE* - Feb. 23rd, 2023/
Recently, I experienced what I'd been fearing all these months. I showed my pass to a bus driver and she did a double-take at it before asking me, "Where did you get that one? It doesn't look like that anymore."\
Luckily, I had two bucks in my pocket so that was the end of that. But, it was apparent I had to update my application to stay consistant with MT's.\
Initially I had produced the icon by making a gif out of a screen recording, which appealed to my lazy nature and hatred for design, but having to completely recreate it to handle a simple color change made me realize that I needed to write the icon from scratch so that it could be easily tweaked if need be.\
At any rate, BusPass 2.0 is faster, sexier, and even more free!\
Keep on chooglin'!
